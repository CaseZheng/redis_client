# redis_client
A C++ redis client which is base on hiredis library, supports cluster and single server node.
(Thanks for the Brian's help.)

There are hiredis libraries for linux and macos in the repository. But it is strongly recommended that you should generate the library from the newest hiredis source code before using this client.
